Alexander C. Howell, of Vienna, New Jersey, was granted a patent for "cream soda-water" on June 27, 1865. Howell's cream soda-water was made with sodium bicarbonate, water, sugar, egg whites, wheat flour, and "any of the usual flavoring materials—such as oil of lemon, extracts of vanilla, pine-apple, to suit the taste". Before drinking, the cream soda-water was mixed with water and an acid such as tartaric acid or citric acid.[2]<br> In Canada, James William Black of Berwick, Nova Scotia was granted a U.S. patent on December 8, 1885, and a Canadian patent on July 5, 1886, for "ice-cream soda".[3]<br>[4] Black's ice-cream soda, which contained whipped egg whites, sugar, lime juice, lemons, citric acid, flavoring, and bicarbonate of soda,[5] was a concentrated syrup that could be reconstituted into an effervescent beverage by adding ordinary ice water.</P>#123

Another variety is referred to as Italian cream soda. Despite the name, this drink originated in the US, not in Italy. The name is due to it being a form of Italian soda.

Ratios vary widely, but the taste is usually that of sweetened, flavored milk.[citation needed]

In Australia, two distinctly different flavored sodas exist. Creamy soda or brown cream soda is vanilla flavored, whereas creaming soda generally refers to a pink soft drink with fruit and berry flavors produced by Kirks, Bundaberg, and Bickford's,[6] among other brands. Another local variant produced by Golden Circle is vanilla and fruit-flavored, and colored yellow to distinguish it from existing brands.[7] More traditional brown varieties are also available, but less common. Brands include Kirks' Sno Drop (only available in South Australia, Victoria, and the Northern Territory), Tarax, River Port, Saxby's,[8] Bert's Snowette (the original recipe of Shelley's Snowcap before the line was acquired)[9] and Schweppes, which also produce a red variety as part of its "Traditionals" range.<br>

The term "creaming soda" is generally used to refer to the drink itself, the combination of soda and ice-cream is called a spider.
